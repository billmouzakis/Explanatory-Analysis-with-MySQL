# Explanatory-Analysis-with-MySQL
In this reposity we can see how we can do an Explanatory Analysis with MySQL. For this analysis, we used laid-off data from the time period between 2020 and 2023. In this analysis we handled
duplicate data, we standardized data (we corrected spelling errors), we handle null and blank values, we navigated ourselves to our data and we calculated the total lay-offs of every company,
we calculated the cumulative sum of the lay-offs from all the companies through every month of the time period, we saw how the companies were ranked based on the total lay-offs the had
for every year, we saw for every year which company had the most lay-offs (which had the second most lay-offs etc.), we saw which companies were the top 5 based on their total lay-offs
for every year.
